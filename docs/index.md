# Welcome to Image Quizzer's Documentation

The Image Quizzer is a customizeable tool that allows for the easy creation of observer studies or learning aids.
The module runs on the [3D Slicer](https://slicer.org) platform. It enables medical image review and contouring/annotation, collection of answers to customizable questions for each image, and will capture responses and contours for offline analysis.
A study administrator can customize a script defining the appearance and flow of the study using a simple eXtensible Markup Language (XML) editor. No programming skills are required.
The tool can be run from any computer, enabling the observer to perform the study at their convenience with no supervision.
