## Description
Descriptor is not a required attribute for the Page element. It is used in combination with the ID attribute (not required)
to identify the Page element.

The ID_Descriptor string combination appears as an identifier in the Slicer layout
when displaying the images. It is also used in the subfolders created in the User's results folder when capturing
contours and measurement lines that the user creates during the quiz.
