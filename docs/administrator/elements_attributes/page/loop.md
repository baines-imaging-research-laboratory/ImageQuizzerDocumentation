## Description

When a page has looping enabled, the user will see a '**Repeat**' button next to the 'Next' button.
By pressing 'Repeat', this allows the observer to repeat the quiz questions and required annotations for another region of interest.
Once the information for all ROIs has been completed the user presses 'Next' to move on to the next page of images and questions. 

This is useful for example in situations where you are presenting images with a number of lesions and
want the observer to contour and answer questions for as many as he/she can find.
