# Administrator guide

## Overview

Setting up the quiz XML is best done using a trial and error approach.
The basic elements of the quiz include the [Session](elements_attributes/session/index.md) and [Page](elements_attributes/page/index.md) elements.


## Set up a simple quiz

Start with the bare minimum and run the Image Quizzer through 3D Slicer.

Once the basic building blocks are in place, add in more features.

!!! Tip
    It is recommended to only set up one full page to start. See how it looks and behaves
    when the Image Quizzer module is active.
    Then copy/paste the Page with ID, descriptor, image path adjustments to make the pages unique.


See [Build a quiz](build.md)
