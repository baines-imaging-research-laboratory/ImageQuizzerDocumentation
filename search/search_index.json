The module runs on the 3D Slicer platform. It enables medical image review and contouring/annotation, collection of answers to customizable questions for each image, and will capture responses and contours for offline analysis. A study administrator can customize a script defining the appearance and flow of the study using a simple eXtensible Markup Language (XML) editor. No programming skills are required. The tool can be run from any computer, enabling the observer to perform the study at their convenience with no supervision.    </p>"},{"location":"#acknowledgements","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"<p>Image Quizzer</p> <p>version 2.2  </p> <p>Credits: Carol A.

This script defines what images and questions are to be displayed and in what order.

This can be used in conjuction with the ImageQuizzer.xsd schema file found in the Resources\\XML folder.</p> <p>Setting up the quiz XML is best done using a trial and error approach starting with the basic elements. Once the basic building blocks are in place, add in more features.</p> <p>It is recommended to only set up one full page to start. See how it looks and behaves when the Image Quizzer module is active. Then copy/paste the Page with ID, descriptor, image path adjustments to make the pages unique.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>When building your quiz, the administrator creates and makes changes to the original XML file.
